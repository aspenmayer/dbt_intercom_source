# Intercom (Source)

This package models Intercom data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/intercom). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K3HTGqNQ-neUNeTtjJq42RHBV68_4FuXFp8X81zJ5Xo/edit#slide=id.p).

This package enriches your Fivetran data by doing the following:

* Adds descriptions to tables and columns that are synced using Fivetran
* Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
* Models staging tables, which will be used in our transform package

## Models

This package contains staging models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Intercom modeling package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_intercom). The staging models name columns consistently across all packages:
* Boolean fields are prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
* Timestamps are appended with `_at`
* ID primary keys are prefixed with the name of the table. For example, [the admin table's ID column is renamed `admin_id`].

## Installation Instructions
Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

## Configuration
By default, this package looks for your Intercom data in the `intercom` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Intercom data is, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    intercom_database: your_database_name
    intercom_schema: your_schema_name
```
